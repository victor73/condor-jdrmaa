Building Condor-JDRMAA
======================

To compile Condor-JDRMAA library, both ant and a Java SDK 1.5 or above or required.

If your system has these installed, simply run "ant" to run the build using the
included build.xml file. At the conclusion of running ant, you
should have a directory named 'dist' with the Java jar file condor-jdrmaa-xxx.jar
in it, where xxx is the version number.
