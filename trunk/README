Compiling Condor-JDRMAA
=======================

To compile Condor-JDRMAA, both the gcc compiler and ant are required. Gcc is
necessary for compiling the C portion of the library while ant, and a Java JDK
are required to compile the Java classes.

If your system has the necessary dependencies, simply run `make` on the command
line that this README document is found in. The provided Makefile will first
compile the C code necessary for the Java JNI mechanism to work. Then it will
will execute ant to run the Java build using the included build.xml file. Since
the C code requires the Condor C implementation for DRMAA, including drmaa.h
and libDrmaa.c, the process requires that you set the CONDOR_HOME variable by
editing the Makefile file iteself. At the conclusion of running make, you
should have a directory called 'dist' with both the shared object file
(libcondorjdrmaa.so) and the Java jar file condor-jdrmaa-xxx.jar, where xxx is
the version number.
